# Machine Learining
## 1) Study of preprocessing methods.Write a program to find following statistics from a given dataset. Mean, mode, median, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, interquartile range.
## 2) Study and implement PCA in python.
## 3) Study and implement simple linear regression.
## 4) Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree-based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
## 5)  Write a program to implement the Naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
## 6) Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
## 7) Write a program to implement SVM algorithm to classify the iris data set. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
## 8) Write a program to implement and check Sklearn’s K-Fold, Shuffled K-fold, Repeated K-Fold and Leave-One-Out validation technique for appropriate classification algorithm and dataset.
## 9)  Write a program to implement k-Means clustering algorithm for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file.
## 10) Write a program to recognize handwritten digit using Artificial Neural Network.
## 11) Study Weka toolkit for demonstration of regression, classification and clustering models on it.
